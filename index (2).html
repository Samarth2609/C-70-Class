      <p class="text-muted" >Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the
        entrance to the cafe.So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are
        on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious,
        the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of
        aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days,
        the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attendif possible. </p>

      <p class="text-muted" >It's a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Must haired tour guide so it will be batter
        to under stand all the things. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls.
        It's a historical site famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to
        measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but
        about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory
        and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago </p>

      <p class="text-muted" >One of the oldest Monastery in Darjeeling. It is situated in peaceful and beautiful
        landscape just 15 minutes walk from Ghoom Railway Station. We can see religious God and Goddess paintings
        believed by Buddhism inside which can give spiritual power to one who prays there with clean heart. From the
        compound of Monastery on a clear day one can have a scenery of hills all around which is great for nature

      <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or
        you'll miss 40% of the fun. At minimum: Infinity WarCivil WarBlack Panther Age ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is
        that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot. There is at the beginning of the
        movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.
        Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

      <p>I took my kids to watch the movie and they loved it. The story shows how a young lion prince, after the murder
        of his father, flees his kingdom only to learn the true meaning of responsibility and bravery. This movie is
        worth a watch for its gorgeous visuals and cinematography. The music was phenomenal. Beyoncé really brought
        Nala to live but the show stealers were Timon and Pumba. Kids would love it.</p>
